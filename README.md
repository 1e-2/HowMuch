**Have you ever asked yourself, "How much space have I wasted on `*.ckpt` and `*.safetensors` checkpoints?"** ðŸ¤”
Say hello to HowMuch: Checking checkpoint wasted space since... well, now! ðŸ˜„ Enjoy this somewhat unnecessary, yet "fun-for-the-whole-family" DiskSpaceAnalyzer tool. ðŸ˜„
## Overview


`HowMuch` is a Python tool designed to scan your drives (or a specified directory) and report on the total space used by files with specific extensions, mainly `.ckpt` and `.safetensors`. 

It outputs:
- The total storage capacity of each scanned drive or directory.
- The space occupied by `.ckpt` and `.safetensors` files.
- The free space available.
- A neat bar chart visualizing the above data.

## Installation

### From PyPI

You can easily install `HowMuch` via pip:

```bash
pip install howmuch
```

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1e-2/HowMuch.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and install:

   ```bash
   cd HowMuch
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage


Run the tool without any arguments to scan all drives:

```bash
howmuch
```

Or, specify a particular directory or drive to scan:

```bash
howmuch --scan C:
```

The results will be displayed in the console, saved to a text file (`HowMuch_output.txt`), and visualized in a bar chart (`HowMuch_chart.png`).
